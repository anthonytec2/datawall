## Where we got our data

As a sample, we took the money laundering dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1). This data simulates what might happen between financial intstitutions.

We are also planning on using other datasets in the future, such as the the credit [card fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
